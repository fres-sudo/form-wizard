# ðŸ”ºWhat is it?ðŸ”º

Form Wizard is a web app that allows users to create interactive, customizable, and shareable forms.

## ðŸ”ºWhy?ðŸ”º

Inspired by [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGXUUXy0AMw&t=9748s), I really thought that the current building form possibilities were outdated and less capable of being simple and interactive. So, I built my own form builder.

## ðŸ”ºHow?ðŸ”º

The app is built with React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Prisma, and DnD-Kit. It is fully integrated with all browsers, the server, and an authentication system.
